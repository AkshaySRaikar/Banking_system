This banking system allows users to create a bank account, deposit money into the account, withdraw money, and view their account details. The system works by maintaining a list of accounts, each with a unique account number, holder name, and balance. The user can interact with the system through a simple menu where they can perform one of the following actions:

Create Account: The user will provide their name, and the system will generate a new account with a unique account number.
Deposit Money: The user can deposit an amount into their account by entering the account number and the deposit amount.
Withdraw Money: The user can withdraw an amount from their account by entering the account number and the withdrawal amount (if sufficient balance is available).
View Account: The user can view their account details, including account number, name, and balance.
